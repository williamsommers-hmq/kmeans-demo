# K-Means Clustering Analysis of MQTT-based signal data

This repo has the code accompanying the blog post "Machine Learning (ML) Techniques in IIoT: Understand, Classify, Categorize, and Action IIoT Data, Part 1"

Manufacturing process control relies on a loop of  data collection, analysis, feedback, and feedback control. Data quality is essential for proper operations.  There are many ways data quality is influenced and managed through manufacturing processes.  Data is used in planning, architecture, process control during the actual production, data collection, and post-manufacturing analyses.   

In this article, weâ€™ll explore how a relatively simple, but powerful machine learning (ML) technique called K- Means Clustering can be used to rapidly ingest and analyze data to gain powerful insights into the operation of your devices, machinery, and sensors in IoT and IIoT applications.
